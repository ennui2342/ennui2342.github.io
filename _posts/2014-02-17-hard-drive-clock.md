At the weekend I was clearing out some junk and came across a pile of
old hard drives. It's a real shame that with the move to solid state,
future generations won't know the magnetic hard drive - mirrored
disks, rare earth magnets, gleaming copper coils - they are things of
great beauty.

I've had a few [hard drive clock instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Recycled-Hard-Drive-Desk-Clock/?ALLSTEPS)
on my project bucket list for a while now, so with a bit of brute force hammering
and the aid of [Makespace's](http://www.makespace.org/) drill press
I knocked up my own homage to the HDD:
