For the last couple of years I've been working in a number of roles -
Consultant, Project Manager, Innovator, CIO - at
[Red Gate], a Cambridge software engineering firm primarily providing tooling for IT professionals.
Last month saw me take up a new role as one of the small team creating
Red Gate Ventures; the innovation, acquisition and investment arm of the
company.

With the fresh start I've made a commitment to refresh my blog, moving
from Blogger to [Jekyll] and [Github Pages] and making, yet again, a commitment to blog about
the stuff I'm involved in. Hopefully this time a routine will finally
stick.

Expect posts about my interest in [maker culture] and my projects, work
related stuff primarily in my areas of responsibility - Mobile, [IoT], [DevOps] and [Big
Data], and maybe the odd diversion into my quest to become a [better
artist][flickr].
