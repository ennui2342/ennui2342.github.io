Thanks to everyone who came along last week to hear our speakers at
[September's Internet of Things meetup][iotcam], and
to our speakers who came along to talk to you.

You can follow Tim as [@tnsmurdoch](http://twitter.com/tnsmurdoch) (might encourage him to tweet more!)
and find out more about Cambridge Consultants at
[http://www.cambridgeconsultants.com]().
Paul tweets as [@Mr_IoT](http://twitter.com/Mr_IoT) and you can find out more about Neul at
[http://www.neul.com]().

Big thanks as always to [Makespace][makespace], who are still accepting members. So if you have
an idea for a great IoT product but don't have the equipment, Makespace
is there for you - we're lucky to have one of the biggest hacker spaces
in the country, so don't waste the opportunity! Check out [the Makespace website]()
and sign up for an induction.

Videos

Next month I hope to have the quality issues conquered and a separate
feed of the slides so they'll be readable!

A few months Hugo Fiennes came to talk to us about Electric Imp. His
[talk at the recent IoT Forum is now online](https://vimeo.com/104612999) and goes behind the curtain
at his previous jobs. Well worth a look.

Books
--------

David Rose's book, [Enchanted objects](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Enchanted-Objects-Design-Desire-Internet/dp/1476725632) is getting a lot of favourable mentions and is on my to-read pile.

Claire Rowland, who spoke at iotcam a few month's back, has her new book,
[Designing Connected Products: UX for the consumer Internet of Things](http://www.wwwamazon.co.uk/Designing-Connected-Products-Consumer-Internet/dp/1449372562),
available for pre-order.

A couple of oldies I haven't mentioned them before but still good: [Designing the Internet of Things](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Internet-Things-Adrian-McEwen/dp/111843062X) by Adrian McEwen and [Makers: The next industrial revolution](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Makersrs-Industrial-Revolution-Chris-Anderson/dp/1847940676) by Chris Anderson.


Upcoming Events
------------------------

20th October - 2nd November: [The Cambridge Festival of Ideas](Designing
the Internet of Things by Adrian McEwen) programme is now available.

15th November: [Elephant and Castle mini maker faire](http://makerfaireelephantandcastle.com) opens its doors.

22nd November: The Cambridge Science Centre is once again running
[Chain Reaction](http://www.cambridgesciencecentre.org/whats-on/events/chain-reaction2014/) at the Guildhall.
This is your chance to get your family together, book a table and build that Rube Goldberg machine you've
always dreamed of.

ThingMonk was one of the best IoT conferences I went to this year, and
they have a [call for speakers out for ThingMonk 2014](http://thingmonk.com).


And finally
--------------

If you're an early stage IoT business looking for business support or
seed funding, drop me a line - Red Gate Ventures has money to invest
especially if you're building IoT middleware software and services.

If you've seen other great speakers and have recommendations, or have
your own story to tell, then drop me a line so we can get the best
lineup for [iotcam][iotcam].

Next month's event will be the 16th October and is a Makespace special
featuring two companies who used the space to prototype products. [Sign

At Neul, Paul’s focus is to promote & exploit the global opportunities
in new kinds of low power wide area networks (LPWAN) to enable the
‘internet of things’. These ‘things’ will range from wearable’s to smart

environmental monitoring to high tech agriculture and many other
applications. For the predicted explosion of IoT devices to become a
reality innovative & new approaches to technologies, networks & business
models is required.
