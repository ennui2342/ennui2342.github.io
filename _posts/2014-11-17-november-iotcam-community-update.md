description: November Cambridge Internet of Things community update
---

Last week we saw an excellent couple of talks at November’s [Cambridge
Internet of Things meetup][iotcam]. Thanks to our speakers and everyone who
attended.

You can follow Richard as [@richsims](http://twitter.com/richsims) (maybe more followers will encourage
him to tweet) and find out more about [TTP](http://www.ttp.com/). Dan
tweets as [@iamdanw](http://twitter.com/iamdanw) and is available to hire if you need a creative
technologist. Thanks also to [Makespace][makespace] for hosting us, if you fancy
joining one of the best makerspaces in the country then head over to the
website and sign up for an induction.

Videos of both our November talks are on Youtube:

If you enjoyed Dan’s talk I would recommend you watch his 2013
dConstruct talk:

I’ve been working with [Collusion](http://www.collusion.org.uk) to pull together Cambridge Invents.
Their video with some of the most talented people in Cambridge talking
about how they changed the world can be seen here:

IoT News
--------
Since my last update, Cambridge is charging ahead establishing its IoT
reputation with news that [Amazon is going to be building drones in the city](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/11/amazon-cambridge-lab/)
, rumours of [Apple setting up shop](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/10/apple-uk-cambridge/),
Qualcomm wanting to create a centre of excellence for IoT around its [acquisition of CSR](http://www.businessweekly.co.uk/blog/cambridge-today-tony-quested/17666-cambridge-building-iot-supercluster),
and Huawei doing the same after [acquiring Neul](http://www.businessweekly.co.uk/blog/cambridge-today-tony-quested/17666-cambridge-building-iot-supercluster)

Perhaps the biggest player in the Cambridge IoT space, ARM, announced
its mbed OS to the world at ARM TechCon and was covered positively by
The Register [here](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/06/arms_tentacles_spread_up_and_down_the_stack/) and [here](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/01/internet_of_things_hold_my_pint_i_got_this_arm_crafts_os_to_rule_them_all/).

HBR published a mammoth, but well written piece on [smart connected
products](https://hbr.org/2014/11/how-smart-connected-products-are-transforming-competition/ar/1).

And the most important news event - I was quoted in an IoT article in
the [Cambridge Evening News](http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/just-Internet-things/story-23151519-detail/story.html) :)


Upcoming Events
------------------------

22nd November: The Cambridge Science Centre is once again running [Chain
Reaction](http://www.cambridgesciencecentre.org/whats-on/events/chain-reaction2014/)
at the Guildhall. This is your chance to get your family
together, book a table and build that Rube Goldberg machine you've
always dreamed of.

2nd - 4th December: [ThingMonk](http://www.thingmonk.com/) was one of the best IoT conferences I went to this year. 
Signups are open for the main event, and this year
they are also running the adjacent [Business of IoT conference](http://thebusinessofiot.io).

11th - 12th March 2015: Cambridge’s big IoT conference, IoT Forum, has opened up for [early bird
registrations](http://iot.thebln.com)

I’ll be taking a break in December from iotcam, but look out for a
January invite with some great speakers to kick off 2015.

There’s still time to check out [Cambridge Invents](http://www.collusion.org.uk/Cambridge-Invents)
for yourself and follow the trail of some of Cambridge’s greatest inventions.


And finally
--------------

If you're an early stage IoT business looking for business support or
seed funding, drop me a line - Red Gate Ventures has money to invest
especially if you're building IoT middleware software and services.

If you've seen other great speakers and have recommendations, or have
your own story to tell, then drop me a line so we can get the best
lineup for [iotcam][iotcam].

Many thanks to our speakers and venue for a great night:
</sub>

<sub>
**Dan Williams** is a software developer interested in how software shapes
our culture. He makes things to playfully explore technology, such as
determining the happiness of British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg
using emotion recognition algorithms (19% happy) or running treasure
hunts across Amazon's network of delivery lockers in London.
Previously he has collaborated with artists and academics as a creative
technologist at Watershed's Pervasive Media Studio, creating projects
such as musical instruments powered by solar wind or stories told
through smell.
</sub>

<sub>
**Richard Sims** works for The Technology Partnership and has been
designing, developing and managing projects in the field of connected
systems for over 12 years. These have ranged from 802.15.4 based
wireless sensor networks for managing the health of dairy cattle, to a
proprietary radio system for use in 'zero-power' electronic point of
sale labels. He has been responsible for multiple projects that have
achieved significant commercial success, with over 7 million nodes in
the field using TTP developed technology. Most recently he has been
working with Mayflower to roll out connected street lighting across the
UK.
</sub>

<sub>
**Makespace** is a community run space, that houses manufacturing and
prototyping kit and provides the surroundings to meet, work, build,
socialise and do amazing things. Makespace has three main aims – to
support existing and new businesses, to raise awareness of and skills
in engineering and manufacturing, and to provide a fun place for
people to hangout and work on projects.
