Yesterday we had our first meeting of 2014 of the [Cambridge Internet of Things
meetup group][camiot] at [Makespace][], the local Cambridge hackerspace. The
venue was packed with about fifty people to hear talks from [Pilgrim Beart](https://twitter.com/pilgrimbeart) and
[Patrick Bergel](https://twitter.com/goodmachine).

The most memorable quote of the night was probably from Patrick:

> Kickstarter, the rectal thermometer of hipster desire

... much as I'd like to, I don't think I'll be able to pull that off in a talk.

As well as being entertaining, the presentations gave us a lot to think
about and to debate in the pub afterwards: the future of IoT technology, standards,
and are the really important problems we should be solving with IoT?

I'm already looking forward to next months talks!
